# Azure Kinect pipelines
This directory contains example SSI pipelines that use the Azure Kinect DK. 

## Running the xml pipelines
If you set up SSI according to its installation documentation, you should have the executable `xmlpipe` on the path.
* Open a terminal in this folder
* Run `xmlpipe <filename>.pipeline`
* Follow the instructions in the terminal if there are any (normally pipelines start automatically)
